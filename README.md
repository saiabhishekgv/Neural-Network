Simple Neural network 

# Install

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Theano
- Keras
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.6 installer and not the Python 2.7 installer.

Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Neural-Network/ (that contains this README) and run one of the jupyter file.This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
